## Introduction
 The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset for machine learning enthusiasts aiming to understand machine learning algorithms, especially classification and regression tasks. This dataset includes measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each sample in the dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. Alongside these features, each instance has a label indicating the species of the iris plant.
