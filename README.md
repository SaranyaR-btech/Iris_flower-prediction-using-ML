# Iris_flower-prediction-using-ML

## Introduction
 The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset for machine learning enthusiasts aiming to understand machine learning algorithms, especially classification and regression tasks. This dataset includes measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Each sample in the dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. Alongside these features, each instance has a label indicating the species of the iris plant.
 In this example, we will approach the Iris dataset with a twist, applying Linear Regression, a method traditionally used for regression tasks, to predict a flower's petal width based on its other characteristics. While Linear Regression is not the typical algorithm for a classification task like species prediction, it can still provide valuable insights when predicting continuous values from the Iris dataset, such as petal or sepal dimensions.After training our Linear Regression model with the Iris dataset, we will deploy the model using Gradio, an easy-to-use library for creating machine learning web interfaces. This will allow users to input flower measurements and receive predictions directly through a web application.
